### Work Done
- Runtime of Jobs/Tasks
- Machine Avaiblility 
+ Attributes are obfusicated: We might need to makes some educated guesses
+ Failure rates: This can help us in failure prediction/modelling
- Task Requests: Using the task resource requests and machine availability, we can check whether over provisioning is actually true.

###Challenges
- Data is 217GB. We have still not run into any problems but we would like to prepare ourselves.
- Plan to tranfer the tables that we build into a DB so that join operations are easy


###TODO:
- Two more tables to look at
- Start looking at publications to see if they produce some result. This would help us validating our results.
